# Monetization Strategy for nukk.nl

## Current Implementation: Wallpaper Ads (WeTransfer-style)

### Overview
We've moved to a wallpaper-only advertising strategy inspired by WeTransfer. This provides a less intrusive, more premium user experience while maintaining monetization potential.

### How It Works
1. **First Visit Only**: Shows full-screen wallpaper ad on initial visit per session
2. **Skip Button**: Appears after 5 seconds (configurable)
3. **Session Storage**: Prevents repeated ads during the same browsing session
4. **Mobile Responsive**: Adapts to all screen sizes

### Implementation Details
The wallpaper ad component (`/src/components/ads/wallpaper-ad.tsx`) features:
- Full viewport coverage
- Smooth transitions
- Skip functionality
- Session-based frequency capping
- Performance optimization through lazy loading

### Configuration
```javascript
// In page component
<WallpaperAd 
  onComplete={handleAdComplete}
  skipDelay={5} // Seconds before skip button appears
/>
```
